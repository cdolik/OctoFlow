The changes include merging the main branch into the gh-pages branch in both `deploy.yml` and `pre-deploy.yml`, and renaming `getAssessmentData` to `getAssessmentState` in the test files. It would be helpful to understand the reasoning behind these changes and whether they could be optimized.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n* **Redundant Merge Step**: The merge step in both `deploy.yml` and `pre-deploy.yml` seems redundant. It's crucial to understand why this merge is necessary in both workflows and whether it could be consolidated or optimized.\n* **Test File Changes**: The renaming of `getAssessmentData` to `getAssessmentState` in the test files requires careful consideration. It's important to ensure that this change doesn't introduce any regressions or unexpected behavior in the tests.\n* **Missing Justification**: The pull request description lacks a clear justification for the changes. It's essential to provide context and explain the reasoning behind these updates to facilitate a more informed review.\n\n### Assessment\nThe pull request aims to update the pre-deploy workflow to align with the deploy workflow, primarily by incorporating a step to merge the main branch into the gh-pages branch. Additionally, it includes changes to use `getAssessmentState` instead of `getAssessmentData` in the test files. While the changes seem straightforward, there are a few points that need clarification and potential improvements. Please have others review and approve this code before merging.",

In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\n## Summary of Changes\nThis pull request focuses on fixing build and import errors, and enhancing the validation flow within the application. It includes changes to the build process, dependency management, and test implementations to ensure the application functions correctly and provides appropriate feedback to the user during the assessment process.\n\n### Highlights\n* **Build Process Fixes**: The pull request introduces a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to define build tasks and updates the `package.json` to use `react-app-rewired` for customizing the build process, addressing potential build errors.\n* **Dependency Management**: The pull request adds `customize-cra` and `react-app-rewired` as dependencies in `package.json` to allow for overriding webpack configurations, specifically to resolve issues with `react-refresh/runtime`.\n* **Workflow Adjustments**: The pull request modifies the `deploy.yml` workflow to adjust the dependencies between jobs, ensuring that deployment occurs after the build and test stages are successful.\n* **Validation Enhancement**: The pull request enhances the assessment validation flow by implementing score threshold checks in `Assessment.tsx` and `Summary.tsx`, preventing progression if the user's score is below the required threshold.\n* **Testing Improvements**: The pull request adds new test cases in `App.test.tsx` and `Assessment.test.tsx` to verify the score threshold validation and the display of summary screen metrics.\n* **Import Fixes**: The pull request fixes import statements in `App.tsx` and `AppRoutes.tsx` to ensure correct module resolution.\n\n### Changelog\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to see the changelog</summary>\n\n* **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json**\n  * Added a new file to define build tasks for the development container.\n* **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**\n  * Modified the workflow to ensure deployment occurs after successful build and test stages.\n* **config-overrides.js**\n  * Added a new file to override webpack configurations and resolve issues with `react-refresh/runtime`.\n* **package.json**\n  * Updated dependencies to include `customize-cra` and `react-app-rewired`.\n  * Modified scripts to use `react-app-rewired` for `start`, `build`, and `test` commands.\n* **src/App.test.tsx**\n  * Added new test cases to verify score threshold validation and summary screen metrics.\n* **src/App.tsx**\n  * Fixed import statement for `AppRoutes`.\n* **src/components/AppRoutes.tsx**\n  * Fixed import statements for `LoadingSpinner` and `ErrorBoundary`.\n* **src/components/Assessment.test.tsx**\n  * Added new test cases to verify score threshold validation and progression control.\n* **src/components/Assessment.tsx**\n  * Implemented score threshold checks to prevent progression if the user's score is below the required threshold.\n* **src/components/Summary.test.tsx**\n  * Added new test cases to verify the display of accumulated metrics and tailored recommendations.\n* **src/components/Summary.tsx**\n  * Implemented score threshold checks to prevent progression if the user's score is below the required threshold.\n  * Added display of accumulated metrics and tailored recommendations.\n* **src/utils/flowState.ts**\n  * Added `validateStageRequirements` function to check score threshold and missing responses.\n* **src/utils/scoring.ts**\n  * Added `calculateStageScores`, `calculateMetrics`, and `getStageQuestions` functions for score calculation and metrics retrieval.\n* **src/utils/storage.ts**\n  * Added `saveMetricsAndRecommendations` function to save metrics and recommendations.\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
