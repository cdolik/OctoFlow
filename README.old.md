## 📌 Development Guidelines

### 🎯 Project Goals

- 🚀 Build a lightweight, GitHub Pages-hosted health check for startup engineering teams
- 🔄 Prioritize clarity, usability, and actionable insights for users
- 🎯 Make it scalable with future iterations based on real startup data

### ⚠️ Development Guardrails

- Stick to MVP scope – No unnecessary features or complexity
- No backend logic – React-only, fully static deployment on GitHub Pages
- Follow React best practices – Keep code modular, maintainable, and efficient
- Use GitHub Copilot responsibly – Avoid premature optimizations

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### 1️⃣ GitHub Pages Setup

1. Go to repository Settings → Navigate to Pages section
2. Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose gh-pages branch (it will be created during deployment)
4. Click Save

### 2️⃣ Configure package.json for Deployment

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/octoflow/",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}
```

(Replace yourusername with your GitHub username.)

### 3️⃣ Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- ✅ Build the React app (npm run build)
- ✅ Create the gh-pages branch (if not already created)
- ✅ Deploy the app to GitHub Pages

### 4️⃣ Verify Deployment

- Wait 1-2 minutes, then visit:
  ```
  https://yourusername.github.io/octoflow/
  ```

- If it doesn't load immediately:
  - Check Pages settings → Ensure gh-pages is selected
  - Clear your browser cache → Try incognito mode

## 🔄 Next Steps

- ✅ Test deployment thoroughly – Ensure scoring & recommendations work as expected
- ✅ Push final adjustments to main branch
- ✅ Begin internal testing with startups & GitHub for Startups members
- ✅ Iterate based on feedback and prepare for public launch
