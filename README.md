            const prNumber = context.payload.pull_request.number;
            const summaryPath = '${{ steps.pr_analysis.outputs.summary_path }}';
            
            if (fs.existsSync(summaryPath)) {
              const summary = fs.readFileSync(summaryPath, 'utf8');
              await github.rest.issues.createComment({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                issue_number: prNumber,
                body: summary
              });
              console.log('Posted OctoFlow Startup GitHub Health analysis to PR #' + prNumber);
            } else {
              console.log('No summary file found at ' + summaryPath);
            }
      
      - name: Generate GitHub Health Report

## üìä GitHub Health Report

OctoFlow generates a comprehensive GitHub Health Report that includes:

- **Overall GitHub Health Score**: A measure of your GitHub practices
- **Investor Readiness Score**: How well your practices align with investor expectations
- **Category Scores**:
  - **GitHub Fundamentals**: Repo structure, PR templates, branch management
  - **Code Collaboration & Quality**: PR reviews, PR size, linked issues
  - **Engineering Velocity**: Time to review, time to merge, reversion rate
- **Recommendations**: Actionable insights to improve your GitHub practices
- **Strengths**: Areas where your team is already following best practices

## üîí Security & Privacy

OctoFlow runs entirely within your GitHub Actions environment and does not send your code or PR data to any external servers. All analysis is performed locally within the GitHub Actions runner.
