# 🚀 OctoFlow – Startup Engineering Health Check

Optimizing startup developer workflow, efficiency, and scalability

## 🛠 About OctoFlow

OctoFlow is an interactive, self-assessment tool designed to help startups evaluate, optimize, and scale their development workflows.

- ✅ Measure your engineering health across key areas like collaboration, CI/CD, security, and AI adoption.
- ✅ Get tailored recommendations based on industry best practices & GitHub resources.
- ✅ Benchmark against other startups and track improvements over time.

Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access & continuous updates.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic health check → Answer a few questions, get instant insights
- Real-time scoring & benchmarks → Compare against industry best practices
- Personalized recommendations → Next steps tailored to your startup stage & team size
- No tracking, no friction → Private, self-serve, and free to use

## 📌 Development Guidelines

### 🎯 Project Goals

- 🚀 Build a lightweight, GitHub Pages-hosted health check for startup engineering teams
- 🔄 Prioritize clarity, usability, and actionable insights for users
- 🎯 Make it scalable with future iterations based on real startup data

### ⚠️ Development Guardrails

- Stick to MVP scope – No unnecessary features or complexity
- No backend logic – React-only, fully static deployment on GitHub Pages
- Follow React best practices – Keep code modular, maintainable, and efficient
- Use GitHub Copilot responsibly – Avoid premature optimizations

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages. This will:
- Build the React app
- Push to the gh-pages branch
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

## 🔄 Next Steps

- ✅ Test deployment thoroughly – Ensure scoring & recommendations work as expected
- ✅ Push final adjustments to main branch
- ✅ Begin internal testing with startups & GitHub for Startups members
- ✅ Iterate based on feedback and prepare for public launch

   - Starts assessment process

2. **Stage Selection**
   - Pre-Seed: 1-5 developers, basic automation focus
   - Seed: 5-15 developers, team collaboration focus  
   - Series A: 15+ developers, scalability focus

3. **Assessment**
   - Stage-specific questions from categories:
     - GitHub Ecosystem (workflows, collaboration)
     - Security (branch protection, scanning)
     - AI Adoption (Copilot usage)
     - Automation (CI/CD, testing)
   - Auto-save feature preserves progress
   - Keyboard navigation support

4. **Summary**
   - Review and edit responses
   - Category-wise breakdown
   - Completion validation

5. **Results**
   - Overall engineering health score
   - Radar chart comparing scores to benchmarks
   - Stage-appropriate recommendations

## Question Mapping

Questions are mapped to stages based on team size and complexity:

- **Pre-Seed Stage**
  - Focus: Basic GitHub usage, essential security
  - Example: Branch protection, CODEOWNERS
  - Weight: Security (1.5x), Automation (1.5x)

- **Seed Stage**
  - Focus: Team collaboration, CI/CD
  - Example: Project management, PR automation
  - Weight: GitHub ecosystem (2.5x), Security (2.5x)

- **Series A Stage**
  - Focus: Advanced security, scalability
  - Example: Secret scanning, advanced automation
  - Weight: GitHub ecosystem (3.5x), Security (3.0x)
