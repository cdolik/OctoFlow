- ✅ Benchmark against other startups and track improvements over time.

Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access & continuous updates.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic health check → Answer a few questions, get instant insights
- Real-time scoring & benchmarks → Compare against industry best practices
- Personalized recommendations → Next steps tailored to your startup stage & team size
- No tracking, no friction → Private, self-serve, and free to use

## 📌 Development Guidelines

### 🎯 Project Goals

- 🚀 Build a lightweight, GitHub Pages-hosted health check for startup engineering teams
- 🔄 Prioritize clarity, usability, and actionable insights for users
- 🎯 Make it scalable with future iterations based on real startup data

### ⚠️ Development Guardrails

- Stick to MVP scope – No unnecessary features or complexity
- No backend logic – React-only, fully static deployment on GitHub Pages
- Follow React best practices – Keep code modular, maintainable, and efficient
- Use GitHub Copilot responsibly – Avoid premature optimizations

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages. This will:
- Build the React app
- Push to the gh-pages branch
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

## 🔄 Next Steps

- ✅ Test deployment thoroughly – Ensure scoring & recommendations work as expected
- ✅ Push final adjustments to main branch
- ✅ Begin internal testing with startups & GitHub for Startups members
- ✅ Iterate based on feedback and prepare for public launch
