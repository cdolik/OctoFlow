## Reporting a Vulnerability

The OctoFlow team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason other than testing
- Report any vulnerability you've discovered promptly
- Do not use automated tools to find vulnerabilities

### Security Measures in OctoFlow

OctoFlow implements several security measures:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts the sources of content that can be loaded, helping prevent XSS attacks.

2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing.

3. **OAuth Security**: Our GitHub OAuth implementation uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) and state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks.

4. **API Key Security**: API keys are validated and we implement proper key rotation practices.

5. **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse, we implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

6. **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data is handled securely and not exposed in client-side code.

7. **Regular Dependency Updates**: We regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep Your Tokens Secure**: Never share your GitHub tokens or include them in public repositories.

2. **Use Strong Passwords**: For any accounts associated with OctoFlow.

3. **Review Permissions**: When authorizing OctoFlow with GitHub, review the requested permissions.

4. **Report Suspicious Activity**: If you notice any suspicious activity, please report it immediately.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as needed. We recommend always using the latest version of OctoFlow to ensure you have the most up-to-date security fixes.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following individuals who have responsibly disclosed security vulnerabilities to us:

## Recent Security Improvements

### March 2024 Security Update

We've addressed multiple security vulnerabilities in our dependencies:

#### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed:
- Prototype pollution in webpack loader-utils
- Improper Neutralization in shell-quote

#### High Severity Vulnerabilities Fixed:
- Multiple ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) issues
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Path traversal issues

#### Moderate Vulnerabilities Fixed:
- Regular Expression issues in various packages
- Potential denial of service vulnerabilities

### Security Measures Implemented

1. **Dependency Resolution Strategy**: We've implemented a comprehensive dependency resolution strategy using npm's resolutions feature to enforce secure versions of all dependencies.

2. **Automated Security Scanning**: We've integrated automated security scanning into our CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early.

3. **Regular Dependency Updates**: We commit to regularly updating dependencies to ensure we're using the most secure versions available.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Always use the latest secure versions of dependencies.

2. **Code Review**: All code changes undergo thorough security-focused code reviews.

3. **Avoid Dangerous Patterns**: Avoid using `eval()`, `innerHTML`, or other potentially dangerous patterns.

4. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs.

5. **Secure API Calls**: Use HTTPS for all API calls and validate responses.

## Investor Readiness

As part of our commitment to being investor-ready, we prioritize security in our development process. Our GitHub Health Analysis tool helps identify security issues in GitHub repositories, and we apply the same standards to our own codebase.

Our security practices align with GitHub's Well-Architected Framework, ensuring that we maintain high standards for code quality, collaboration, and engineering velocity while keeping security at the forefront.
