# OctoFlow Architecture

## Overview

OctoFlow is a React-based assessment platform built with TypeScript, focusing on accessibility, reliable state management, and smooth user experience. The application uses modern React patterns and hooks for state management and side effects.

## Core Systems

### State Management

- **Storage System**: Uses IndexedDB for persistent storage with a fallback to LocalStorage
- **User Preferences**: Centralized preference management with real-time updates
- **Assessment Flow**: Stage-based progression with validation and recovery mechanisms

### Component Architecture

#### Higher Order Components (HOCs)
- `withAutoSave`: Provides automatic saving functionality with retry logic
- `withFlowValidation`: Ensures proper stage progression and validation
- `withMemo`: Performance optimization for expensive renders

#### Core Components
- `ErrorFallback`: Handles error display and recovery
- `LoadingSpinner`: Provides visual feedback with accessibility
- `Timer`: Manages time-based interactions
- `NavigationGuard`: Prevents accidental navigation loss
- `PreferencesPanel`: Manages user settings
- `StageTransition`: Handles stage progression

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Component → HOC Validation → State Update → Storage → UI Update
                     ↓
             Audio Feedback
                     ↓
         Accessibility Announcement
```

### Error Handling

1. **Error Boundaries**: Catch and handle React rendering errors
2. **API Error Recovery**: Implements exponential backoff
3. **State Recovery**: Automatic state restoration from persistence
4. **Validation Errors**: Proper user feedback with recovery options

### Accessibility Features

- ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- Keyboard navigation support
- Audio feedback system
- High contrast mode support
- Motion reduction options
- Screen reader optimizations

## State Persistence

### Storage Strategy
```
IndexedDB (Primary)
    ↓
LocalStorage (Fallback)
    ↓
Memory (Temporary)
```

### Saved Data Types
- Assessment progress
- User preferences
- Stage completion status
- Time tracking data

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component behavior testing
- Hook functionality verification
- Utility function coverage

### Integration Tests
- User flow validation
- Error recovery scenarios
- Storage system reliability

### Accessibility Tests
- ARIA attribute verification
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based splitting
   - Component lazy loading
   - Dynamic imports for heavy features

2. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Memoization of expensive calculations
   - Debounced state updates
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists

3. **Resource Management**
   - Efficient audio resource loading
   - Optimized asset caching
   - Background data persistence

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- Automated through GitHub Actions
- Environment-specific builds
- Cache optimization
- Continuous integration checks

### Build Process
1. Test execution
2. Type checking
3. Asset optimization
4. Bundle generation
5. Deployment verification

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Additional assessment types
   - Enhanced data analytics
   - Multi-language support

2. **Performance**
   - Worker thread utilization
   - Service worker implementation
   - Advanced caching strategies

3. **Accessibility**
   - Enhanced voice navigation
   - Customizable feedback systems
   - Additional accommodation options
